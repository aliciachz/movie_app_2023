                "synopsis": "Al enamorarnos, apostamos. Y es un juego demasiado \u00edntimo para asimilar con facilidad el fracaso. Elena sabe que el enfriamiento que atraviesa su matrimonio no es algo temporal. Alberto , su marido, un joven y prestigioso ingeniero aeron\u00e1utico, acaba de entreabrir una nueva puerta y parece decidido a atravesarla con alguien que no es ella. Alberto no pretende fingir, sencillamente est\u00e1 desorientado. Quiere a su mujer y a su hijo, pero intuye que la pasi\u00f3n que le inspira Diego es algo m\u00e1s que deseo. Diego, traumat\u00f3logo en una cl\u00ednica privada, es un hombre sin dobleces ni prejuicios que se tira de cabeza a la piscina del amor arriesgando en ello su estabilidad emocional y profesional, como le advierte su jefa y buena amiga, Eva. Los enga\u00f1os, las escenas de dolor, y la desconfianza crecen, interponi\u00e9ndose entre los tres amantes. La confrontaci\u00f3n es inevitable, y la ruptura se acelera. Pero Elena no est\u00e1 dispuesta a ceder sin m\u00e1s. Despu\u00e9s de echar un vistazo a la situaci\u00f3n, tensa los m\u00fasculos, prueba el sabor de otros abrazos y se reafirma en sus sentimientos. Sin perder un minuto, vuelve a colocar su ficha en el tablero. Y Alberto se debate entre las dos caras del amor.\u2014Anonymous",
